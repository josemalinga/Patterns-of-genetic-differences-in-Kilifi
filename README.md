# Patterns-of-genetic-differences-in-Kilifi

Contains code and data from the paper:

Investigating the drivers of the spatio-temporal patterns of genetic differences between <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria infections in Kilifi County, Kenya. Malinga J, Mogeni P, Omedo I, Rockett K, Hubbart C, Jeffreys A, Williams T, Kwiatkowski D, Bejon P & Ross A. <i>Scientific Reports</i> 2019, 9: 19018

The code runs a simulation model of <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> malaria infections and fits it to genotyping data from Kilifi in order to estimate the mean distance between parent and offspring infections and to test simple hypotheses about drivers of the temporal and spatial genetic patterns observed.

There was an error in the orginal publication but this has now been corrected online and in the pdf. We erroneously stated that the mean of a half-normal distribution was sigma, but it is sigma*sqrt(2/pi). This lead to small changes throughout the manuscript.
